      <h1>About Berlin Transportation Guide</h1>
      <p>
        My name is David Annin. I am an IT Support professional currently expanding my skills in cloud computing and learning German. I graduated from Koforidua Technical University in Ghana with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Computer Network Management.

        I enjoy solving problems—especially when I can approach them with a creative twist. Alongside my IT work, I have a strong creative background. I previously worked as an illustrator for children’s books at Kwadwoan Publishing in Ghana, where I also served concurrently as the company’s IT support.

        This website is one of my personal passion projects. I have been living in Berlin for about four months at the time of writing, and like many newcomers, my beginning here was not easy. One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding how the Berlin public transportation system works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe that if I struggle with something, others are likely facing the same problem too. This website is my attempt to turn that challenge into a solution. It is a simple, beginner-friendly introduction designed to help you understand how Berlin’s transportation system works, so you can feel more confident and avoid getting lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this project makes your journey in Berlin a little easier.
